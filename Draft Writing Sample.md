## The Evolution of Business Intelligence

When it comes to Business Intelligence, a variety of consultantcies, start-ups, tech-companies, and even universities crowd a cacaphonous bazaar of "turn-key enterprise-solutions for Big Data". While the value proposition is powerful, the in-house technical capacity to wield such powerful tools is complicated by a variety of factors.

This flourishing market is evinced by lower technical barriers to entry: many of the overly engineered data-infrastructre technologies like OLAP Cubes, DataMarts, and the MDX programming language are being quietly side-stepped in favor of Lake House style storage solutions like Apache Delta Lake.

This means that many of the more sophisticated front-ends which business users interact with are becoming a repsonive way to query their data. And, for the most part, top-of-mind software like SAP, Salesforce, Tableau, and Microsoft Power BI  harness these "back-end" improvements imperceptably smoothly.

More over, the modularization of software into what's categorically known as "microservices", allows developers to create BI products of exponentially more complexity, exponentially more quickly. Because microservices are usually both opensource and containerized, the underlying infrastructre of many apps and services are reliably "plug-and-play". However, these technical products are at risk of vastly outpacing the technical sophistication of the rest of the labor market.
